# Supabase Blog Setup Instructions

## Current Issue
The blog page is trying to connect to Supabase database tables that don't exist yet, causing:
- 404 errors when fetching blog posts
- Hydration mismatches due to date formatting

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes
- ‚úÖ Fixed hydration mismatch with consistent date formatting utilities
- ‚úÖ Created proper database migration script
- ‚úÖ Updated environment variables with Supabase credentials

## üîß Required Supabase Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Navigate to your project: `kawfyzoalccwgdstnndx`
3. Go to "SQL Editor"
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/001_blog_setup.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute the migration

This will create:
- `user_profiles` table for blog authors
- `blog_categories` table for post categories
- `blog_posts` table for blog content
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Sample blog posts and categories

### Step 2: Verify Tables Were Created
In the SQL Editor, run:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('blog_posts', 'blog_categories', 'user_profiles');
```

You should see all three tables listed.

### Step 3: Test Blog Data
Run this query to see the sample posts:
```sql
SELECT title, status, published_at FROM blog_posts;
```

You should see 3 sample blog posts with published status.

### Step 4: Create Admin User (Optional)
To access admin features, create a user profile with admin role:
```sql
-- First, you need to sign up a user through your app or Supabase Auth UI
-- Then run this to make them an admin:
INSERT INTO user_profiles (id, email, full_name, role) 
VALUES (
  'your-user-id-here', 
  'admin@theaiceo.com', 
  'Admin User', 
  'admin'
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET role = 'admin';
```

## üß™ Testing the Blog

### After Database Setup
1. Visit: http://localhost:3002/blog
2. You should see:
   - 3 sample blog posts about AI
   - Categories filter working

   - No hydration warnings

### Sample Blog Posts Include
1. **"Why 70% of AI Projects Fail"** - AI Strategy article
