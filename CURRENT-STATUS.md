## 📋 Current Errors & Solutions

### **Error 1: Database Relationship Not Found**
```
Could not find a relationship between 'blog_posts' and 'user_profiles'
```
**Solution:** Run the Supabase migration script - tables don't exist yet

### **Error 2: Multiple Supabase Client Instances**
```
Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context
```
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed by optimizing client creation in `supabase.ts`

### **Error 3: Image Optimization Warnings**
```
Image with src "/aiceoicon.jpg" has either width or height modified
```
**Solution:** Minor - add `height: "auto"` to image styles (cosmetic only)
